## OIL
### Open Image Labeling
---

</center>
<br/>

OIL is an open-source image labeling library. The project is inspired by [Comma AI's comma10k dataset](https://github.com/geohot/comma10k/).

### The final product

You can load your own image, define your custom labels e.g: foreground, background. Then you open the LabelingGUI and mark each region of the image. Then you can save the labeled image to a custom file for labels. Theese label files shouldn't be much larger, than the original image. The extra information is the region coding, as the user can extract only a specific region e.g. self-driving cars need lane data, the sky label is useless in that case.
